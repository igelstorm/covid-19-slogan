# Randomly generated COVID19 advice

Inspired by [the time that the UK Government changed its official COVID19 slogan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52605819) from "Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives" to the much less actionable "Stay alert, control the virus, save lives". This is a tiny one-page application that generates a random slogan that will probably make a similar amount of sense.

Made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), mostly because it has a tiny footprint compared to other unnecessarily large frameworks. It could've been done with vanilla JS, to be honest.
